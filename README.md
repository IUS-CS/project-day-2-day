# project-day-2-day
Project Day-2-Day is designed as a bridge between daily work/life schedule planning tool and academic planning tools developed for the C346 Course. At its core, it is a organization tool that looks to help manage daily tasks, organize assignments assigned by academic institutions, and additionally allow the creation of custom notes within each of the tasks that either you or the instution creates. 

Product Vision
======
The goal is to create a calendar/task-manager that allows integration with the academic platform of Canvas and allow the users to better plan their day-to-day life. We aim to provide a one-stop hub where the planning extends beyond the scope of just academics. Everyday users can use the task-manager as a space for notes, deadlines, important meetings, appointments, much more.

Key Features
======
As the current product is a work in progress, we hope on delivering the following features:

1. Canvas Integration
2. Day-2-Day Organizer
⋅⋅⋅⋅* Based on the calendar everyone knows with (potentially) some customization features to make it less 'bland' and make it more personal.
3. Task Notes
⋅⋅⋅⋅* Create your own notes for indiviual items or have them there for that day.
4. Application
⋅⋅⋅⋅* Use it as either an executible on your local machine or use it on the web! (HEAVY WORK IN PROGRESS)
